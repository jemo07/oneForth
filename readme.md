OneForth is a simple Forth-like interpreter built in Python. It provides a basic REPL interface for executing Forth-like commands and also comes with a GUI interface built using Tkinter.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`
- Stack operations
- Dictionary view with `.dict` command
- Command history in the REPL
- GUI interface with colored output

## Installation

## Usage

### Console-based REPL

Run the `oneForth.py` script:

You'll be greeted with the `ok>` prompt. Start entering your Forth-like commands.

A window will open with a similar `ok>` prompt. Enter your commands in this window.
